## About

Project for IT Academy. This Laravel app will be used by the managers of a soccer league to track matches, teams and players.
It includes a MySQL database to store information of the matches, the teams, and the players of each team, and the relationships between them. To access the elements of the database, Eloquent ORM is used. 
The Front-End uses Blade and TailwindCSS.
